#BUILD A FORUM - CRUD APP

This project builds a forum page for an existing website, BaubleBar. The purpose of the forum is to create a social online community for BaubleBar enthusiasts aka stylin fashion jewelry aficionados who can discuss their thoughts on products, get advice, suggest new products/ old products they want brought back and much more.

#App features listed
(which I learned through this project, hooray!)

Model view controller method. It makes a lot of sense to separate out the various routes and mongoose parts of this app.
NPM - used EJS Layouts and liked how easy it was to use 
Method Override - 
#Styling features
Using Bootstrap made it easy to make a nav bar.
Actually liking the topic of my forum topic made thinking about the content to be posted
I also liked favicon.

Challenges faced during this project 
Practically every part of this is very challenging. I hadn't succesfully made a CRUD app before so most of this was pretty new. Changing one thing often led to something else breaking. Since I didn't fully understand many concepts, such as routing, if my database was succesfully posting to the database, and what was going on in general...twas difficult, but through my numerous mistakes I learned! I learned about RESTFUL routes. Small mistakes, such as a missing ">" or mislabeling an input caused me many hours of consternation.
