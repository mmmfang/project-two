#BUILD A FORUM - CRUD APP

This project builds a forum page for an existing website, BaubleBar. The purpose of the forum is to create a social online community for BaubleBar enthusiasts aka stylin fashion jewelry aficionados who can discuss their thoughts on products, get advice, suggest new products/ old products they want brought back and much more. So my users are fans of the brand or those who want to discuss accessories! These people are good fashionistas...not sketchy internet people...so they are getting a lot of trust since they can edit and delete any post! (To be changed if I have the time)

##Technology Used
- HTML
- CSS
- node.js & express
- mongoose

## What I Learned (tldr: a whole lot)

- How to make CRUD app - Create read update delete - I hadn't finished a CRUD app before so this was a win
- Model View Controller - this method makes a lot of sense to separate out the various routes and mongoose parts of this app.
- NPM - used many packages and really liked how easy EJS Layouts was to use 
- Restful routes - Got to flesh out the concept of restful routes and use method override to patch and delete in addition to getting and posting
- Sessions - the concept of storing a session and having the user persist
- Favicon - fun 

###Positives
- Using Bootstrap made styling much quicker - the nav bar took me about a minute! I used my app.css a lot to get the specific styling and color scheme I wanted.
- Since I based this on an existing site, made it easy to think of user stories and who my target audience was. It also was why I chose black headings and the main font of Roboto, so it would look connected to the actual company.
- Liking my forum topic - I had fun writing posts (too bad I spent a lot of time being witty in my local forum so only I will see it...)
- Having struggles upon struggles upon struggles really drilled down some concepts and helped me understand the topic. I could have done with less consternation though....
- My peers are very smart! I liked that they could help me with certain aspects and I could help them too not feel like a complete dodo


###Challenge 
- Practically every step was very challenging. 
- So many names sound similar (user, users, User, etc etc) and it really tripped me up trying to reference the correct one, and also which one meant what.
- Same with routes, not really understanding them at first
- Changing one thing often led to something else breaking (insert terrified face emoji) 
- I would have wished to retained some more of my sanity...but we can't have it all...
