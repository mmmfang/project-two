#Project Two - Mae

To Do: write a README here

This project is building a forum page for an existing website, BaubleBar. It's purpose is to have a place for BaubleBar enthusiasts aka fashion jewelry aficionados to discuss their thoughts on the products and suggest new products or old products they want brought back.

Early victories:
Learning the model view controller method. It makes a lot of sense to separate out the various routes and mongoose parts of this app. 
Using Bootstrap made it easy to make a nav bar.
Basing this on an existing site guided my color and font decisions. 
Liking my forum topic made thinking about the content to be posted, fun.
I liked EJS layouts and how easy it is to use!
I also liked favicon, how fun.

After days (DAYS?!??) my pages started rendering.

Early challenges: 
Practically every part of this is very challenging. CHanging one thing often leads to something else breaking. At this point, I can't get past the C phase because things are not redirecting/saving to my MongoDB, which means I can't get to the RUD parts (insert anxious emoji)
